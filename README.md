Always use clear and meaningful names, comments, and JavaDoc.
Always test the program and use the debugger to fix errors.
Always remember to declare the type of variables, otherwise it will get an error.
Use break to end loops, you can use if statements in order to quit when the condittional has been executed.
readln won't read integers, remember to parse them before hand.
Use try/catch to handle errors without the programm crashing.
In order to use theWholeFile to write a file, first convert the ArrayList into a List<String>.
When wanting to write a file with StandardOpenOption.WRITE, also use StandardOpenOption.CREATE. If not, it won't work.
Be sure to use variables in scope, if not, it will appear as it is not declared.
